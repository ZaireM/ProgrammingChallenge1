# Programming Challenge 1

## Challenge
 The ThreadedMatrixMultiply.c file demonsrates a threaded version of the matrix multiplication program. The example is a hard-coded for a 3x3 matrix using three threads to distribute the calculation load.

## Type this into the terminal to run the makefile
 make

 ## Type this to run the program
 ./ThreadedMatrixMultiply.exe

 ## Conflict
 If this is ran more than once you will have to delete the ThreadedMatrixMultiply.exe and ThreadedMatrixMultiply.o files to run again
